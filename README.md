# Projecting-Atmospheric-Carbon-Dioxide-concentrations
### Introduction: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Global Monitoring
Division makes public its measurements of atmospheric CO2 concentrations on their website:
https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/
Included in the Moodle assignment are two data files, downloaded from this site, cataloging monthly
measurements of carbon dioxide concentrations at a site in Mauna Loa, Hawaii from 1958 until the
present.
###### co2_mm_mlo.txt 
is the full text file, including a header describing the allowed use of the data and the
meaning of the various columns in the dataset.
###### co2_data.txt 
is a truncated file with all but a single header stripped, containing the columns of data.
